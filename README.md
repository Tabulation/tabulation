Tabulation
==============

Code is all in one file for testing purposes.
Tabulation is an open-source program, currently being developed by a bunch of students as a project in HTL Rennweg.

Our aim is to help guitarists, who want to share their songs/melodies/whatever, but don't want to type in every single note.
Instead, with this program, they will be able to use their guitar as a keyboard. <3
